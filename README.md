# Weather Dashboard

## Description

- The purpose of this project was to create a weather Dashboard. 
- This project allowed be to practice using functions and making third part api calls.
- I used vanilla javascript to code everything.
- all html and css where created by me and not imported. 

## Usage

- Enter a city name into the search box and it will return the weather data for that city
- The weather data returned will show the current weather as well as a five day forecast for the future. 
- Your previous search is saved to local storage so you can use it again for the future.  
- My portfoilio can be viewed at the following link: https://iluton.github.io/Weather-Dashboard/
